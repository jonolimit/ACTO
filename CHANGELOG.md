## [0.7.3] - 2025-12-21

### 🔧 Dashboard Key Management Fixes

This release fixes critical issues with API key management in the dashboard.

#### Fixed

- **Key Actions via Event Delegation** - Rename, toggle, and delete buttons now work reliably using event delegation instead of inline onclick handlers with JSON.stringify (prevents HTML attribute parsing issues)
- **Delete Keys Permanently** - Delete button now permanently removes keys from the database instead of just deactivating them
- **Toggle vs Delete Distinction** - Toggle (on/off switch) deactivates keys but keeps them visible; Delete removes them completely
- **Key Statistics Loading** - Fixed 401 errors when viewing key statistics (requires `ACTO_JWT_SECRET_KEY` environment variable on Vercel)

#### Changed

- Improved success checking for delete operations
- Keys list now loads with `include_inactive=true` to show toggled-off keys

#### Important

- **Vercel Users**: Set `ACTO_JWT_SECRET_KEY` environment variable with a fixed secret to prevent JWT validation issues across serverless instances
