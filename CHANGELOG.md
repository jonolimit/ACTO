## [0.9.5] - 2025-12-21

### 🐛 SDK Client Fix

#### Fixed

- `client.get_proof()` now correctly parses API response format
- API returns `{"proof_id": ..., "envelope": ...}` - client now extracts envelope

---

## [0.9.4] - 2025-12-21

### 🐛 CI/CD Fix

#### Fixed

- Updated GitHub Actions test to not import removed `verify_proof`
- Test now validates `ACTOClient` import instead

---

## [0.9.3] - 2025-12-21

### 🐛 Server Hotfix

#### Fixed

- Server now uses internal verification function (`_verify_proof_internal`)
- SDK continues to block local verification (requires API)
- Fixed Vercel deployment crash due to missing import

---

## [0.9.2] - 2025-12-21

### 🔧 Helius RPC Integration

This release ensures all token balance checks use the backend's configured RPC (Helius) instead of public endpoints.

#### Changed

- Backend uses Helius RPC for all token balance checks when configured
- `rpc_url` is now optional in `/v1/access/check` - defaults to backend config
- SDK clients default to empty `rpc_url` (backend uses Helius)
- Removed hardcoded public RPC from dashboard and playground
- Updated all documentation to reflect Helius integration

#### Fixed

- Dashboard and playground no longer send public RPC URL
- Consistent RPC usage across all token gating checks

---

## [0.9.1] - 2025-12-21

### 🔒 API-Only Verification

This release removes local proof verification. All proofs must now be verified through the ACTO API to ensure integrity, compliance, and fleet tracking.

#### Breaking Changes

- **`verify_proof()` removed** - Local verification is no longer available
- **`verify_proof_async()` removed** - Use `AsyncACTOClient.verify()` instead
- **`ProofChain.verify_chain()`** - Now requires an `ACTOClient` parameter

#### Migration Guide

**Before (0.9.0):**
```python
from acto.proof import verify_proof
is_valid = verify_proof(envelope)  # ❌ No longer works
```

**After (0.9.1):**
```python
from acto.client import ACTOClient
client = ACTOClient(api_key="...", wallet_address="...")
result = client.verify(envelope)  # ✅ Use API verification
print(result.valid)
```

#### Changed

- `verify_proof()` now raises `ProofError` with migration instructions
- `verify_proof_async()` now raises `ProofError` with migration instructions
- `ProofChain.verify_chain(client)` now requires ACTOClient parameter
- Updated all documentation to reflect API-only verification
- Updated README.md, docs/API.md, examples/, and Jupyter notebooks
- Updated dashboard documentation

#### Why This Change?

- **Integrity**: Centralized verification ensures all proofs go through the official API
- **Compliance**: Enables audit trails and compliance reporting
- **Fleet Tracking**: Enables automatic device discovery and fleet management
- **Token Gating**: Ensures only authorized users can verify proofs

## [0.7.3] - 2025-12-21

### 🔧 Dashboard Key Management Fixes

This release fixes critical issues with API key management in the dashboard.

#### Fixed

- **Key Actions via Event Delegation** - Rename, toggle, and delete buttons now work reliably using event delegation instead of inline onclick handlers with JSON.stringify (prevents HTML attribute parsing issues)
- **Delete Keys Permanently** - Delete button now permanently removes keys from the database instead of just deactivating them
- **Toggle vs Delete Distinction** - Toggle (on/off switch) deactivates keys but keeps them visible; Delete removes them completely
- **Key Statistics Loading** - Fixed 401 errors when viewing key statistics (requires `ACTO_JWT_SECRET_KEY` environment variable on Vercel)

#### Changed

- Improved success checking for delete operations
- Keys list now loads with `include_inactive=true` to show toggled-off keys

#### Important

- **Vercel Users**: Set `ACTO_JWT_SECRET_KEY` environment variable with a fixed secret to prevent JWT validation issues across serverless instances
